# Electro Store Camera

An iOS app, part of old project [Electronic Storehouse](https://github.com/barthap/ElectronicStorehouse). For now, it is no longer developed, but it has working implementation of transferring images between iPhone and Java service using Apple Bonjour.

In `/ServerPlayground` there's an ugly Java code for Bonjour service, which allow communication with the Swift app.
